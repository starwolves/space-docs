# Console Commands

It is possible to add new commands for clients to enter by just adjusting server-side values. Console commands are for a part server-side and modular.

Please search for existing commands ie "spawn_entity" and see and learn how we can listen to commands in a modular way. 

RCON status is handed out by default to all players in the current prototype, but in the future it is restricted to users who know a certain password and login with it through the console first. With brute force protection and all.
