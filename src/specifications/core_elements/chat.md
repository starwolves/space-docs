# Chat

The chat is a way for players to communicate with one another, effeciently over the radio as well. It possible for any entity to become capable to interact with the chat so they can speak messages, such as AI or automated systems! There are three types of chat `radio`, `global` and `proximity`. Also when ending chat messages with *"!!!"* proximity talk becomes yelling and could be heard through walls.
