# Core Components

There are several components which will be used many entities.
Sometimes it is not just as easy as editing a few values in components to get your desired results. The API currently consists of a mix between events and editing component properties to trigger the right things.
The components seen here are very frequently used amongst Space Frontiers entities and some depend on eachother for correct behaviour. So if you are adding a new entity make sure you also add the right selection of `core components`.
