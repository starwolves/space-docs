## Docs

What you will find here is strictly technical documentation, predominantly related to the server as it is authorative and even mods are strictly modular server-side code additions.
Therefore the technical contributions from the Space Frontiers community will be server-side improvements and server-side mods.

This documentation is an open-source project and anyone can contribute to it over at [this repository](https://github.com/starwolves/space-docs)!

**The documentation is still in a very early stage and a work-in-progress, if you would like to see certain improvements please let us know!**
