# Adding a new humanoid

It is currently already possible and not too hard to add new (player controllable) humanoid characters, as long as the 3D character meshes are rigged with Mixamo. From there on only slight content adjustments have to be made. Access to the map and content editor is required. This is not yet released, but a release will be worked on upon request.
