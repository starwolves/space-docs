# Adding a new ship tile

Gridmap tiles get initialized at `src/space/core/gridmap/mod.rs`. This is where you add new ship tiles to be registered into the gridmap. After also making the right content folder additions, you can construct your new tiles with the construction_tool.

In order to add a new ship cell (aka gridmap tile) and implement it into an existing or new map, access to the map and content editor is required. This is not yet released, but a release will be worked on upon request.
